A simple React JS script to create a dynamic login/sign up/home page with google authentication functionality to provide one click automation of Google Suite services.

Please note that a core file is missing (node_modules) and the following commands must be excecuted in bash to add it locally: 
1. npm -i
2. ng serve

To run on localhost, do the following:
1. export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider (only needed on startup)
2. npm run

Thanks
